# Psono-user-generator

The users.csv file should contain the users' email addresses.
#### createUsers.py
If the user has not yet been created, then a password will be generated and saved to a users.csv.  
Commands for creating a user will be written to the psonoCMD.txt file. They need to be executed on the psono server.
#### sendMessages.py
This script will send emails to users with login information to the server.



To create additional users, you can add new information to the users.csv. Then you need to re-run the scripts.
